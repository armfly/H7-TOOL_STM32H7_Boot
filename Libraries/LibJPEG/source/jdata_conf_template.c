  * @brief   This file implements LibJPEG read/write functions.
  *          This file should be copied to the application folder and modified 
  *          as follows:
  *            - Rename it to 'jdata_conf.c'.
  *            - Implement read/write functions (example of implementation is 
  *              provided based on FatFs)
